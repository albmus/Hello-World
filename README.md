I am a Director of Sacred Music & Organist.  I have been in my craft for 29 years; sacred music has been part of my life for 47 years.  I am considering a career change.  I won the Computer award as a senior in high school, and was going to major in computers.  However, I got turned onto liturgical church music and majored in that instead.  I love what I do. However, I am ready to work with the frozen arts and inanimate objects, things I can more predictably manipulate with my creativity and imagination.  I am looking to be eventually be free from the work environment, to work in my own home, and to use my music as a hobby rather than as an livelihood.  I am grateful for the opportunity that Free Code Academy is giving me online to learn the necessary skills.  I am a bit disheartened that, according to my calculations, it will take me a solid year of 40 hours per week to get through all the levels; my job is already 40+ hours per week.  However, if I find I love coding, then I'll take the time in stride.  ~A. Lee Barlow, 12-30-16
